It's given an array (indexed from 1) of N elements on which we make M queries:

add(Left, Right, X) - all the elements between the position Left and Right (1<=Left<=Right<=N) are raising their values with X.

After all the operations are completed, print the array.

example

Array: 1 1 1 4 5 6

operations: (1, 5, 2), (2, 3, 10)

Final array: 3 13 13 6 7 6
